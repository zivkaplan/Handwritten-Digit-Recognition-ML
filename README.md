# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-ML

## First project in ML with TensorFlow

A small TensorFlow script using the MNIST db to train a model to recognize hand-written digits. 

Run the model on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fVj25CWmok61lzaUbBTf0Mm-iHgUI_wq#scrollTo=3GL4VMcM_Gsv) (Work in progress)

For this project I created a page for creating "Hand written" digits in the right resolution to test the model. (see [here](https://github.com/zivkaplan/Draw-digit-28x28-), source [here](https://github.com/zivkaplan/Draw-digit-28x28-))
